  abstract = {Maglev is Google's network load balancer. It is a large distributed software system that runs on commodity Linux servers. Unlike traditional hardware network load balancers, it does not require a specialized physical rack deployment, and its capacity can be easily adjusted by adding or removing servers. Network routers distribute packets evenly to the Maglev machines via Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP); each Maglev machine then matches the packets to their corresponding services and spreads them evenly to the service endpoints. To accommodate high and ever-increasing traffic, Maglev is specifically optimized for packet processing performance. A single Maglev machine is able to saturate a 10Gbps link with small packets. Maglev is also equipped with consistent hashing and connection tracking features, to minimize the negative impact of unexpected faults and failures on connection-oriented protocols. Maglev has been serving Google's traffic since 2008. It has sustained the rapid global growth of Google services, and it also provides network load balancing for Google Cloud Platform.},

  abstract = {Accurate voting system is the primary component of democracy to represent people's actual mandate in governance. It plays a vital role in smooth functioning of administration at its various levels, like centre, state, municipality, corporation, etc. With the proliferation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), voting process in India is all set for a major upheaval. Th is process is successfully leveraging the benefits of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to administer delivery of multifaceted Electronic Services (E-Services) like Electronic Voting (E-Voting), Electronic Banking (E-Banking), Electronic Healthcare (E-Healthcare), Electronic Education (E-Education), etc to populace. Furthermore, to achieve data security during these Electronic Communication (E-Communication), Cloud Computing may be used as an interface for the transacting parties to deliver various electronic services to end users. Hence, any type of conventional service delivery system can be enhanced to its equivalent technology based platform so as to recover the issues faced through the conventional system. Even, this electronic communication can be used to monitor real time data that changes frequently with reference to time. In this paper, authors ha ve proposed a Cloud Voting System (CVS) to deliver prompt results to all stakeholders in a flawless manner, which will explore research scope to perform Electronic transaction through strict user authentication protocol and will resolve the Latency problem of Cloud Voting System (CVS). During our research work, we will also gradually explore the prospect and limitations of our proposed model with reference to real world parameters.},
